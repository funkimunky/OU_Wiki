<h1 id="ouw_s47_0">Specify the purpose</h1>

<p>To determine the number and spacing of yellow painted lines that provides adequate warning to drivers approaching a
    junction to slow down safely.</p>

<p>The safety lines prior to the junction are to ensure drivers are warned; visually, audially and physically. The lines
    should be spaced appropriately to give the driver the impression the vehicle is moving faster than it is, thus
    encouraging the driver
    to decelerate.</p>

<h1 id="ouw_s47_1">Create the model</h1>

<p>We will first try to determine how far away from the junction the lines should start, in order to encourage the
    driver to decelerate at a safe constant rate and come to a stop at the junction.&nbsp; We use one of the equations
    for constant acceleration
    to relate initial and final velocity of the vehicle to the acceleration and the distance travelled. This will then
    be used to determine how many lines are needed and how they should be spaced out.&nbsp; For this we will use an
    arithmetic sequence
    to determine how the spacing between the lines will change as the lines get closer to the junction.</p>

<h2 id="ouw_s47_4">Formulating mathematical relationships</h2>

<p>First, we consider how far from the junction the yellow lines should start.&nbsp; So, we need to determine what
    distance is needed to allow vehicles to slow down at an appropriate rate and come to a stop at the junction.&nbsp;
    In order to do this, we
    will use the formula for constant acceleration, which relates distance to acceleration, initial velocity and final
    velocity.</p>

<p>This formula applies to motion in one dimension so we assume that the road is straight (assumption 1) so the distance
    <em>S</em>&nbsp;is a straight line.&nbsp; Also, in order for this equation to be applicable we assume that vehicles
    will slow down at
    a constant rate and that drivers will start to slow down at the start of the yellow lines.&nbsp; We assume that
    there is no traffic queueing at the junction and that the yellow lines go right up to the junction, so driver has
    the full distance <em>S</em>&nbsp;to
    slow down and stop.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$v^2\ =\ u^2\ +\ 2aS$$</p>

<p>and have S as the distance the lines begin from the junction,</p>

<p>We assume that vehicles come to a stop at the junction so the final speed is zero</p>

<p>assume final speed is zero</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$0\ =\ u^2\ +\ 2aS$$</p>

<p>or</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$-2aS\ =\ u^2$$</p>

<p>If we take the slowest value of deceleration as about -0.9 ms<sup>-2</sup> (Bokare and Maurya, 2017),
    it means we get a different value of when the lines begin that depends on the speed limit of the road (assuming
    drivers are doing the speed limit).</p>

<p>If it was a 60 mph limit dual carriageway (27 ms<sup>-1</sup>), it means the lines would begin at:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$S\ =\ -\ (27)2\ /\ 2\ \times\ 0.9$$</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$S\ =\ 405\ metres\ from\ the\ junction.$$</p>

<p>The next part of the model aims to determine how much the gaps between the yellow lines should reduce by as they get
    nearer to the junction. For this we use an arithmetic sequence. We assume that the gaps between successive pairs of
    lines are reducing
    at a constant rate i.e. that there is a common difference in the distances between each successive pair of lines. So
    each gap will be shorter than the one before it. </p>

<p>Let $$d_0$$ be the initial distance between the first two lines and let $$d_f$$ be the distance between the final two
    lines right at the junction, then we can write:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$d_0\ -\ n\ dx\ =\ d_f$$ 'n' is the number of lines after the initial line, n=1 for the
    first spacing). So:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$n\ dx\ =\ d_0\ -\ d_f$$</p>

<p>If we want to have 10 metres between the first two lines and 1 metre between the final two lines, this would
    give:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$n\ dx\ =\ 10\ -\ 1$$</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$n\ dx\ =\ 9$$</p>

<p>We can then define how much we want to reduce the spacing by, which will progressively increase as n increases, and
    this tells us how many lines we'd need. So if we wanted to progressively reduce the distance by 0.25 metres, we'd
    need n = 9/0.25 = 36
    lines. </p>

<p>So by setting $$dx$$ as the amount each gap gets reduced by, we gradually decrease the line spacing.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; padding: 30px 15px"><img
        src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/wikiimages/Diagram%20of%20reducing%20line%20spacing_2.jpg"
        alt="illustration showing line spaces for formula above" width="600" height="772"
        class="img-responsive atto_image_button_text-bottom"></p>

<p>So the sequence is essentially: $$d_n\ =\ d_0\ -\ ndx$$. This gives us each successive line spacing.</p>

<p>Now, linking where the lines begin with the number and spacing...</p>

<p>The average spacing between lines $$\frac{d_0\ +\ d_f}{2}\ \times\ number\ of\ lines\ (n)\ =\ S\ (distance\ lines\
    begin\ from\ junction).$$</p>

<h2 id="ouw_s0_2" style="background-color: lime">Do the mathematics (need to check what goes in here)</h2>


<h2 id="ouw_s63_0">Derive the first model:</h2>

<p>Given the above relationship, we can determine the number of lines.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$\frac{d_0+d_f}{2}\ \times\ n\ =\ -\frac{u^2}{2a}$$</p>

<p>Therefore, number of lines:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$n\ =\ -\frac{u^2}{a(d_0\ +\ d_f)}$$</p>

<p>Where $$u\ =\ speed\ of\ vehicle\ when\ it\ reaches\ the\ lines$$</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$a\ =\ acceleration\ (deceleration)$$</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$d_0\ =\ initial\ line\ spacing,\ and$$</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$d_f\ =\ final\ line\ spacing,\ as\ above.$$</p>

<p>We can then substitute n into the equation linking the line spacings $$d_f = d_0 - ndx $$</p>

<p>This gives us:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$d_f = d_0 + \frac{u^2 dx}{a(d_0+d_f)} $$</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$d_f = \frac{d_0\ a\ (d_0\ +\ d_f)\ +\ u^2\ dx}{a(d_0\ +\ d_f)}$$</p>

<p>Expanding:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$a\ d_f(d_0\ +\ d_f)\ =\ a\ d_0(d_0\ +\ d_f)\ +\ u^2\ dx$$</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$a\ d_f\ d_0\ +\ a\ d_f^2\ =\ a\ d_0^2\ +\ a\ d_0\ d_f\ +\ u^2\ dx$$</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$a\ d_0^2\ -\ a\ d_f^2\ =\ -u^2\ dx$$</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$a(d_0^2\ +\ d_f^2)\ =\ -u^2\ dx$$</p>

<p>So, distance between the lines, $$dx$$ is:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$dx\ =\ -\frac{a(d_0^2\ +\ d_f^2)}{u^2}$$</p>

<p>This relates the distance between the lines to the initial speed of the vehicle and it's rate of deceleration,
    together with the initial and final line spacings.</p>

<p>And we work out how many lines as above, $$n\ =\ -\frac{u^2}{a(d_0\ +\ d_f)}$$</p>

<h2 id="ouw_s64_0">Draw graphs</h2>

<p>Here's a first attempt at some relationships we might get based on the above equations. Some might not all be
    relevant. I thought I'd just put them all here and we can decide what ones are relevant and correct, and which to
    ditch.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/wikiimages/Graphs.jpg"

<p>Applying the method of dimensional analysis to the model gives:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$d_x\ =\ \frac{a(d_0^2\ -\ d_f^2)}{u^2}$$</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$L\ =\ \frac{L\ T^{-2}(L^2\ +\ L^2)}{(L\ T^{-1})^2}$$</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$L\ =\ \frac{L^3\ T^{-2}}{L^2\ T^{-2}}$$</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$L\ =\ L$$</p>

<p>sfor our equation for <em>n:</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$n\ =\ -\frac{u^{2}}{a(d_0\ +\ d_f)}$$</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$[1]\ =\ \frac{{[L\ T^{-1}}]^2}{[L\ T^{-2}][L]}$$</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$[1]\ =\ \frac{[L^{2}\ T^{-2}]}{[L^{2}\ T^{-2}]}$$</p>

<h2 id="ouw_s0_3">Interpret the results</h2>

<p>Using data for the spacing found in Traffic Signs Manual Chapter 5 Page 73 (Traffic Signs Manual Chapter 5 Page 73
    Table 6-1 Spacing of bars on main carriageway, 2019)</p>

<p>This gave the distance between the first pair of yellow lines ( $$d_0$$
  in our formula) as 7.7m and the distance between the final pair of yellow lines
    ($$d_f$$
 in our formula) as 2.7m.</p>

<p>For the initial velocity we will use the speed limit for the road in question. We will start with a speed of
    60mph as this is a common speed limit. This is equivalent to a speed of 27 metres per second.</p>

<p>Finally, to find a suitable value for acceleration we referred to a study entitled Acceleration-Deceleration
    behaviour of various vehicle types, (Bokare and Maurya, 2017)</p>

<p>This study found that trucks had a deceleration rate of about 0.9ms<sup>-1</sup>and cars had a rate of about 4ms<sup>-1</sup>.&nbsp;
    As this is a safety feature we will use a fairly low deceleration rate of 0.9ms<sup>-1 </sup>to allow for the fact
    that
    there will be many different types and sizes of vehicle on the road.</p>

<p>We can now enter these figures into the equation formulated for <em>d<sub>x</sub></em></p>

<p>We have:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$ dx = - \frac{a(d_0^2 - d_f^2)}{u^2} $$</p>

<p>So, inputting the numbers of</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$ a = -0.9 ms^{-1}, u = 27 ms^{-1}, d_0 = 7.7 m, d_f = 2.7 m $$:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$ dx =&nbsp;- \frac{-0.9 (7.7^2 - 2.7^2)}{27^2} $$</p>

<p>This gives,</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$ dx = 0.064 m $$ or about $$ 0.06 m $$</p>

<p>And for the number of lines, we have:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$ n = \frac{-u^2}{a(d_0 + d_f)} $$</p>

<p>Inputting the above numbers gives,</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$ n = \frac{-27^2}{-0.9(7.7 + 2.7)} $$</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$ n = 77.9 $$</p>

<p>So we would need $$ 78 $$ lines.</p>

<p>So, using the above data, we would have 78 lines with a gradual reduction of spacing of 0.06 metres.</p>

<p>For a speed limit of 50mph (22ms<sup>-1</sup>) we have:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$ d_x=-\frac{(-0.9)(7.7^{2}-2.7^{2})}{22^{2}} $$</p>

<p>Which gives:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$ d_x=0.097m $$ or about 0.10m</p>

<p>The the difference in the spacing between successive pairs of lines for a 50mph road would be 0.10m</p>

<p>The number of gaps between pairs of yellow lines is given by:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$ n=\frac{-(22^{2})}{(-0.9)(7.7+2.7)} $$</p>

<p>Which gives:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$ n=51.71 $$</p>

<p>So approximately 52 gaps (53 lines) would be needed on a road with speed limit of 50mph</p>

<p>For a speed limit of 70mph (31ms<sup>-1</sup>) we have:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$ d_x=-\frac{(-0.9)(7.7^{2}-2.7^{2})}{31^{2}} $$</p>

<p>Which gives:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$ d_x=0.049m $$ or about 0.05m</p>

<p>The the difference in the spacing between successive pairs of lines for a 70mph road would be 0.05m</p>

<p>The number of gaps between pairs of yellow lines is given by:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$ n=\frac{-(31^{2})}{(-0.9)(7.7+2.7)} $$</p>

<p>Which gives:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$$ n=102.67 $$</p>

<p>So approximately 103 gaps (104 lines) would be needed on a road with speed limit of 70mph</p>

<p>For speed limits of 50, 60 and 70mph we have numbers of gaps and spacings as follows:</p>
